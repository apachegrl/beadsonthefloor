        <h3>Findings, Tools and Links</h3> 
       
        <p>A good place to buy all of your tools, supplies, beads and findings is Metalliferous located in the heart of the jewelry district. Many of the supplies sold in bead stores are carried here and are much cheaper beacause bead stores markup the tools and other items. They also sell French Wire Bullion in three different sizes and it is sold here cheaper per yard than the bead stores.</p>
        
        <p>Bead boards, mats and other organizers, like everything else in beading, are sold online or in the local craft stores.  Needles for needle weaving techniques come in different sizes and lengths and the instructions of your project will provide that information. For all other crafts such as knitting, crocheting, wire working or jewelry making, your project should furnish the needed information on bead sizes, etc.  Beading kits for Beginners are sold in local stores, on Amazon, Michael's and many other web sites. Watch Youtube videos first to learn the many different types of bead techniques.</p>
        
        <h3>Tools and Containers</h3>
        <p>Purchase a good basic kit for beading; this is not the time to buy cheap tools. And keep a second set of tools handy; losing tools is expensive!  You'll need cutters (for cutting some of the rods); crimpers, needlenose pliers (to open jump rings), flathead pliers, bead reamers (if you work with pearls or glass beads, you may need to enlarge the hole a tiny bit); thread conditioner (beeswax or Thread Heaven, both indispensible for working with silk or nylon thread); nylon "wire" such as Beadsmith. Size D Nymo nylon thread is sold as a bobbin or a spool.  Again, consult a good resource manual such as The Beader's Companion for this information.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, purchase sturdy containers for your bead stash. You may want to separate your precious stones like pearls, onyx, mother of pearl, coral, etc. from your Czech beads or just categorize your beads by colors or type/family. Most seed beads, like Delicas, come in containers while others are in cellophane bags.  If they are in bags, find a small jar to keep them in.</p>
