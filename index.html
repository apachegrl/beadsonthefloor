        <h1>Bead Stash</h1><br>
        <p>What is a "bead stash?" A bead stash, depending on who you ask (and if they are honest), is the nice little hoard of beads you bought and have hidden somewhere. Every crafter, especially beaders, is a hoarder to some extent.  Beaders are like dragons: shiny little things attract their attention very quickly so you can become very good friends with a beader.  Your friends, significant others or even your spouse will indulge in the habit of feeding your addiction to shiny pretty things.  They will locate the latest bead store before you find out about it! Some beaders are familiar with the beads they find at local stores like Michael's; many shop at stores that specialize and sell only beads. But everybody who beads has a good stash.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>A good bead stash should consists of seed beads of various sizes, beads that are of different shapes and sizes as well as different configurations, (i.e., chips, cubes, round, squared, tubular and novelty).  A good stash of beads will hopefully inspire your creative side and have fun.  It helps to know what kinds of beads are out there for purchase and to know how to use them.  An excellent reference source is essential to build bead knowledge.  The <em>Beaders' Companion (Expanded and Updated) by Judith Durant</em> is an excellent source <a href="https://www.interweave.com/store/beaders-companion"></a>. This manual contains clear pictures and diagrams of various beading stitches, done step-by-step; needle sizes and their uses; thread types, conditioners and bees wax and their uses in beading, as well as the proper tools to use in projects; graph paper of beading projects among other things. It also contains information on semiprecious stone beads (amethyst, onyx, coral, etc); new products, off-loom weaving; knitting, crochet and tatting with beads. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and other social media platforms also host beading groups.  Beading kits for beginners in these various crafts are sold on Amazon, Michael's and many web sites.  Watch Youtube videos first to learn the technique you choose to do.</p><br>

        <br>
        <p>Good reference magazines include Bead and Button Magazine <a href="http://www.facetjewelry.com/magazine/bead-button"></a> which contains beading diagrams and instructions; Bead Style Magazine <a href="http://www.beadstylemag.com"></a>; Bead and Jewellery Magazine <a href="www.beadmagazine.co.uk"></a> and Beadwork Magazine<a href="www.interweave.com"></a>.  Many of these sites also have links to free patterns and other goodies to download.  Online sites such as Beading Daily (also affiliated with Interweave) provides tutorials as do the other sites. Lastly, look for beading groups in your local area through the internet or beading magazines.</p><br>
            
        <p>Remember this about Beading: it can be a relaxing and creative hobby and sometimes provides extra cash if you decide to sell your product,  but first and foremost, remember it can be an EXPENSIVE hobby. Leave the credit card at home unless you have iron will to resist over-spending!</p><br>
    
        <h2>Findings, Tools, Containers</h2> 
        <br>
        <p>A good place to buy tools, supplies, beads and findings is Metalliferous <a href="www.metaliferous.com"></a>located in the heart of the jewelry district. Many of the supplies sold in bead stores are carried here and are cheaper. Bead stores markup the tools and other items so this place would be a good first stop</p><br>
        <p>Bead boards, mats and other organizers are sold online or in the local craft stores.  Needles for needle weaving techniques come in different sizes and lengths and the instructions of your project will provide that information. For all other crafts such as knitting, crocheting, wire working or jewelry making, your project should furnish the needed information on bead sizes, etc.  Beading kits for Beginners are sold on Amazon, Michael's and other web sites.  Watch Youtube videos first and see what beading is about and the many different types of bead techniques there are.</p><br>
       
        <p>Tatting is a form of lacemaking and resembles crochet using fine thread.  There are two different methods of tatting: one with a needle, the other with a shuttle.  Shuttles can be made with 1 or 2 bobbins, or one in which the yarn is wound around a center post.  Shuttles can be made of metal and decorated with inlaid mother of pearl; wood or plastic with or without a point.<a href="http://lacis.com/catalog/data/AB_TattingShuttles.html"></a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tatted-Lace-Beads-Techniques-Beanile/dp/0916896935/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pl_foot_top?ie=UTF8"></a>. Amazon has a Historical Folk Toys First Tatting kit to learn the basic shuttle skills and this kit is also sold at the Historical Williamsburg, VA site. For needle tatting, I would suggest watching Youtube videos before trying this with needle or shuttle. <a href="https://www.snowgooselace.com/product/beginner-tatting-kit-shuttle"></a>. There are also organizations that support tatting as a craft. Tatters Across Time <a href="www.tattersacrosstime.org/"></a> has a program for beginners to masters and you can request a mentor to assist you. The apprentice phase has 6 designs to do. Other tatting groups are international and are listed on Links. There is a link attached to see a tatted piece. <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/558235316293214106/?lp=true"></a></p><br>
 
        <p>Kumihimo is a form of Japanese braiding that incorporates beading as well.  Amazon's Starter Kit includes the KumiLoom Disk, bobbins, booklet and necklace cord in its kit. There are other links on the Links page. <a href="https://www.beadaholique.com/kumihimo-101-how-to-kumihimo"></a></p>
